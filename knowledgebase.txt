Model                   When to use
ARIMA                   Stable patterns, no strong seasonality
SARIMA                  Strong seasonality (weekly, yearly, monthly, etc.)
SARIMAX                 Seasonality + external factors (ex: ads, holidays)
Holt-Winters (ETS)      Trend + seasonality, simple & effective
Prophet (Meta)          Works well for business data, handles holidays, outliers
LSTM / GRU              Complex patterns, long-term dependencies
Random Forest Regressor For structured ML-based regression (must convert TS to supervised format)
XGBoost / LightGBM      Often best for many real-world forecasting tasks


Metric          Full Form                                               Purpose
MAE             Mean Absolute Error                                     Average absolute error
MSE             Mean Squared Error                                      Penalizes large errors
RMSE            Root Mean Squared Error                                 Error in original units
MAPE            Mean Absolute Percentage Error                          % error, easy for businessS
MAPE            Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error                Better % error when values are small
