🌟 What is Time Complexity?
Time complexity = how the running time grows as input size grows.
Think of it as:

“If the input becomes 10× bigger, how much slower does my program get?”

💡 Real-life analogy
Imagine you're counting money in a jar.

If you have 10 coins, you take a few seconds.
If you have 1,000 coins, you take more time.
If you have 1,000,000 coins, you take even more time.

Your work grows proportionally with number of coins — that’s like O(n).

🌟 Most common time complexities (in simple words)
1) O(1) → Constant time
⏳ Time does NOT change even if input gets bigger.
Example:
Looking at the 1st page of a book
→ Doesn’t matter if book has 10 pages or 1000 pages.
In code:
Pythonarr[0]  # always takes the same timeShow more lines

2) O(n) → Linear time
⏳ Time grows directly proportional to input size.
Example:
Counting all coins in a jar:
more coins = more time.
In code:
Pythonfor c in s:    print(c)Show more lines

3) O(n²) → Quadratic time
⏳ Time grows much faster.
Input doubles → time becomes 4×.
Example:
Comparing every student with every other student.
In code:
Pythonfor i in s:    for j in s:        print(i, j)Show more lines

4) O(log n) → Logarithmic time
⏳ Time grows VERY slowly even if input grows huge.
Example:
Guessing a number between 1–100 using yes/no questions

Is it > 50?
Is it > 75?
→ This is binary search.


🌟 What is Space Complexity?
Space complexity = how much extra memory the algorithm uses while running.
💡 Real-life analogy
You have a desk where you do work:

If you only need 1 notebook, that's O(1) space.
If you need one sheet of paper per coin, that’s O(n) space.

It’s about memory usage, not time.

🌟 Simple examples to make it super clear
✔ Example 1: Using a set to find distinct characters
Pythonlen(set(s))Show more lines
Time complexity — O(n)
You must check each character once.
Space complexity — O(k)
Where k is number of unique characters.
You must store each unique character in memory.

✔ Example 2: Using a loop
Pythonfor i in range(len(s)):    print(s[i])Show more lines
Time: O(n)
You touch each character once.
Space: O(1)
You don’t store anything extra, except a loop counter.

🌟 If you understand these two examples — congratulations 🥳
You already understand 90% of Big‑O.

📦 Time complexity → How long it takes
📦 Space complexity → How much memory it needs
Both depend on how your algorithm grows as data grows.
